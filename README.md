# Unscented Kalman Filter Project

This implements an Unscented Kalman Filter in C++ and runs it agains a simulation of a radar and lidar measurements of a car as it travels around our frame of reference - that is, our vehicle where the lidar and radar devices are mounted.  The image below shows the screen shot of the simulator.  The car icon in the screen shot is the car that is being tracked.  The red circles are radar measurements, the blue circles are lidar measurements, and the green triangles are the estimates generated by my program.

<br />

The simulator has 2 different simulations/datasets it can run - Data Set 1 and Data Set 2 - each of these being a different path for the car.  The simulator also provides ground truth for calculating errors.  The program connects to the simulator via raw sockets - port 4567. 

The Unscented Kalman Filter generates estimates of the car's position and velocity which are better than the measurements provided by either the radar or lidar.  You can see this visually in the screen shot of the simulator above.   The green triangles representing the Extended Kalman Filter estimates are more of a smooth curve which is how we would expect a vehicle to traverse naturally, while the red and blue cirlces of the radar and lidar measurements appear more noisy. 


The Unscented Kalman Filter iimproves upon the Extended Kalman Filter in that calculating a Jocabian matrix is no longer required.  Instead, the prediction is based on a sample of the current state.  These sample points are called sigma points.  The sigma points can then be tranformed into the measurement space and a new mean and covariance matrix calculated.  From this the new prediction is made and then combined with the new measurements.  The Unscented Kalman Filter also improves in overall error as is shown below.

I also calculated the NIS per the project description.

## Results

Since the simulator provides ground truth values, I was able to calculate errors for the estimates as mean squared error - MSE.
Running the code against Data Set 1, I recorded the following MSE's for x position (Px), y position (Py), velocity in the x direction (Vx), and velocity in the y direction (Vy).

Variable | Measure
-----|-----
Px | 0.0752
Py | 0.0892
Vx | 0.3451
Vy | 0.3343

This compares favorably with the results from the Extended Kalman Filter shown below.

Variable | Measure
-----|-----
Px | 0.0964
Py | 0.0853
Vx | 0.5154
Vy | 0.4316
